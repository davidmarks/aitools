## ðŸ“Œ Tools

### 1. **Chat Context Compressor**
A simple yet effective tool for compressing chat session contexts into a compact "context pill." This pill can be copy-pasted at the end of your current chat session and reused to initialize a new session, saving tokens and maintaining continuity across conversations.

How to use:
1. **Copy the Prompt:** 
   At the end of your chat session, use the provided prompt to generate a "context pill."
2. **Paste in New Session:**
   Copy the generated context pill and paste it into a new session to initialize the conversation with minimal token usage.

### 2. **Agentic Patterns Library**
I list of useful agentic AI application patterns (e.g. reflector). Right now this is a simple list with descriptions of use, if agentic frameworks stabilize for a bit I may drop some code frameworks here in the future.
